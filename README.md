# How to run the test application

1. `yarn install` the dependencies.
2. `yarn start` to start the front-end.
3. `yarn run start-server` to start the back-end.

# Task directions

- Complete at least 4 types of tests below (unit, integration, component and E2E tests).
- The goal is augment the project with tests to ensure correct operation in the future.
- You can use any tool to achieve this. `Cypress` is a preferred framework for testing, but you can use a framework of your choosing as well (it does not affect scoring).
- You can change the source code to accommodate it for tests, as long as you are not breaking functionality.

# Ideas for tests

You can rely on your own experience as to what types of tests are added, but here are a couple ideas to get started:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Component tests (preferable with Jest. For better understanding https://medium.com/opendoor-labs/testing-react-components-with-jest-a7e8e4d312d8)
- E2E tests
- Test coverage instrumentation
- Visual regression tests
- Type safety

# Deliverables

- You need to return all project files with the added tests.
- In case you find a bug(s) feel free to create a report.
